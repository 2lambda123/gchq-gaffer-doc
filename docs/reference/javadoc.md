# Gaffer Javadoc

Gaffer is primarily written in Java so all of the operations and functions
available stem from a Java class. As such, there are extensive generated
Javadocs to aid with the understanding and usage of these classes and their
associated methods.

The Javadocs can be browsed via the window below or via the [hosted site.](https://gchq.github.io/Gaffer/overview-summary.html)
