# Federated Store

The Federated Store is a Gaffer store which forwards operations to a collection of sub-graphs and returns a single response as though a single graph were queried.

For more information on the federated store, see [the v1 federated store walkthrough](https://gchq.github.io/gaffer-doc/v1docs/getting-started/developer-guide/federatedstore.html) (to be updated and added to this documentation in future).
