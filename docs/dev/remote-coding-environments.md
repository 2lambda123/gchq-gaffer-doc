# Remote Coding Environments For Gaffer

Gaffer is now configured for remote coding environemnts such as GitHub
Codespaces and Gitpod. This addition allows for an easier and faster way to
contribute to Gaffer with no manual setup or need to download dependencies to a
local machine.

## GitHub Codespaces
To use GitHub Codespaces simply open the gaffer repsoitory and click the "Code"
button drop down. You'll see an option labeled "Open with codespaces" Click on
it.

This will launch Codespaces with all the correct configuration needed to
contribute to the Gaffer repository.

## Gitpod
To use Gitpod you can simply prefix any GitHub URL with **`gitpod.io/#`** and
follow the steps from there. You can also install the
[extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension)
on your web browser. This adds a button to GitHub that does the prefixing for
you.

Once on Gitpod, your environment will be set up with all the correct
configuration needed to contribute to the Gaffer repository.
