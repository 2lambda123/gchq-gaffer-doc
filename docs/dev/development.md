## Source Control

Development of Gaffer is done on the [GCHQ/Gaffer](https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer) GitHub repository, or other Gaffer GitHub repositories under the [GCHQ Organization](https://github.com/orgs/gchq/repositories).

## Building Gaffer

### Build Instructions

The latest instructions for building Gaffer [are in our README](https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/blob/develop/README.md#building-and-deploying).

### Supported Platforms

A recent Linux distribution is recommended, although it should be possible to build Gaffer on any system which has the latest version of Java 8 or 11 (the Gaffer codebase uses Java 8). Running tests on Windows is not recommended due to complexities with native libraries.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the project. See our [ways of working for more detail](ways-of-working.md). All contributors must sign the [GCHQ Contributor Licence Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/gchq/Gaffer).
