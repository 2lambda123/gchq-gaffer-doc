Gaffer
======
Gaffer is built for very large graphs.

It's designed to be as flexible, scalable and extensible as possible, allowing for rapid prototyping and transition to production systems.

Gaffer does 

 - rapid query across very large numbers of entities and relationships,
 - versatile query-time summarisation, filtering and transformation of data,
 - in-database aggregation of rich statistical properties describing entities and relationships,
 - scalable ingest at very high data rates and volumes,
 - automated, rule-based data purge,
 - fine grained data access and query execution controls.

Gaffer can be run on various databases, including Accumulo and HBase. It is also integrated with Spark for fast and flexible data analysis.

To get going with Gaffer, visit our [getting started pages](summaries/getting-started.md).

Gaffer is still under active development and isn't a finished product yet. There are still plenty of new features
to be added and additional documentation to write. Please contribute.
