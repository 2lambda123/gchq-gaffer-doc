# Export To Csv

The ToCsv operation allows a user to export data from a running Gaffer instance to an iterable of CSV formatted strings.
This operation can be chained together with ExportToLocalFile, which will take the iterable of strings and write them to a 
local file. The ToCsv operation requires a CsvGenerator, this can be built by the user, alternatively it can be autogenerated by 
supplying the operation with a CsvFormat. CsvFormats that are currently supported include those used by Neo4j and AWS's 
Neptune graphs, both of which are based on the openCypher [format](./openCypher) but have slight differences.


## Example
The following example shows how to build a chained operation in order to export data from a Gaffer graph and write it to a local file.
In this instance the example will be outputting the elements from Gaffer's Road Traffic Example into an openCypher formatted CSV file
compatible with neo4j.
