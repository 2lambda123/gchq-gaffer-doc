# Gaffer 2.1.0 Changelist

Below is a summary of potentially breaking changes that have been made in Gaffer version 2.1.0.
A list of all changes in this version [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/releases/tag/gaffer2-2.1.0). This page covers only changes which may impact existing Gaffer installations.

## Store Cache Suffix property rename

The property configuring the [suffix to use for cache service entries](../../administration-guide/gaffer-stores/store-guide.md#suffixes) was changed from `gaffer.cache.service.name.suffix` (as used in 2.0.0 and before) to `gaffer.cache.service.default.suffix`.
In addition to this, properties allowing for more detailed suffix configuration were added.

## Federated Store Merge Functions JSON property rename

When supplying configuration for the [Federated Store Merge Functions](../../administration-guide/gaffer-stores/federated-store.md#setting-default-merge-functions) to use,
the JSON property was incorrectly set as `configuredMergeFunctions` in 2.0.0, when it should always have been `storeConfiguredMergeFunctions`. Corrected [in this commit](https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/commit/e90fba0cb33ca23ab60cd1e2c175dfd29801fde1).
