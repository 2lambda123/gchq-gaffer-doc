# User Guide

Welcome to the Gaffer user guide. The pages under this section are intended to
help a user of Gaffer understand the core concepts and quickly get started
querying a currently deployed graph.

If you are brand new to Gaffer and graph databases in general, the Gaffer basics
pages contain useful information to give an overview and foundation.

- [What is Graph?](./gaffer-basics/what-is-a-graph.md)

Gaffer comes with a few different APIs, the pages in the user guide give an
introduction to these APIs and how to use them to query a graph. Also included
is an introduction to some of the core languages used for the APIs.

- [What is JSON?](./gaffer-basics/what-is-json.md)
- [What is Python?](./gaffer-basics/what-is-python.md)
- [REST API](./apis/rest-api.md)
- [Python API (gafferpy)](./apis/python-api.md)

To query a graph Gaffer uses a custom querying format based around isolated
functions called `Operations`. This user guide gives an introduction to this
format and provides examples to help users formulate their own.
